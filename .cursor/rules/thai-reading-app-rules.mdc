Project Description
Thai Tale is a thai reading and practice app that uses AI Deepseek api to create choose your own adventure stories. The AI response will provide at least: A story that takes into account some user parameters such as genre, number of paragraphs, etc, it will provide choices the user can pick to progress the story, and a summary of the story to pass to the next api call for context.

Clicking a thai word will pop up a translation to english from our mongoDB, if no translation can be found, we will send a request to the AI with the word and format requirements and when we get the response, we will add it to our database.
